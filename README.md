## Description

- This Webpage allows those who visit the chance to add some notes that they want to look back at.

- This site was built to help me start a Webpage wiht some starter code and it was a challenge but I believe it's good work.

- This challenge helped me understand how to start making websites that connect node, js, html, css and pushing it all to Heroku.
